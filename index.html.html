      <h2>A Simple Daily Oil Routine For Healthier-Looking Nails</h2>
      <p>
        If you feel uncomfortable showing your feet because of how your nails look or how the skin
        around them feels, you’re not alone. A gentle, consistent routine can help you feel more
        confident in sandals, at the beach, or just relaxing at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most talked-about options in this space is a plant-based nail & foot oil called
        <strong>Kerassentials</strong>, designed to be used at home as part of a simple daily routine.

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why Many People Are Looking For A Better Nail & Foot Routine</h2>
      <p>
        Over time, nails can start to look dull, discolored, or rough. The skin around them can feel
        dry and uncomfortable. Tight shoes, long days on your feet, and lack of proper care only make
        things worse. It’s no surprise that so many people hide their feet and avoid going barefoot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of ignoring the problem, more and more people are adding a simple, at-home oil routine
        to support the appearance of their nails and the comfort of their feet. Products like
        <strong>Kerassentials</strong> were created to fit exactly into this kind of self-care habit.
